# This repo is to demonstrate a bug with Strapi v5

To see the issue:
* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/CodeTotee/strapi-dz-crash`
* Install: `yarn install`
* start strapi: `yarn develop`
* Navigate to: `http://localhost:1337/admin/content-manager/single-types/api::home.home`

Crash.

Here are the steps I used to create this crash:
* Install and intialize a fresh Strapi v5 project
```
npx create-strapi-app@beta --use-yarn
cd strapi-dz-crash
yarn
yarn develop
```
* Open admin at `http://localhost:1337` and configure admin email
* Navigate to Content-Type Builder
* Create a component called 'comp' with a single text field 'text'
* Create a Single Type called 'home' with a single Dynamic Zone that includes the 'comp' created above
* Save
  * Note: At this point, things still work.  If you then navigate to Content Manager and select 'home', it will display an empty DZ.
* Navigate back to the Content-Type Builder
* Navigate to the 'home' Single Type
* Add a single Text type called 'text'
* Navigate to Content Manager
* It will crash with an error saying `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'push')`
